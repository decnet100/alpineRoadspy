# alpineRoadspy

used to detect road features semi-automatically from video feeds of alpine roads

## Goal

From a continuous video drive along a mountain road, produce an inventory of
roadside features — traffic signs, delineator posts (Leitpfosten), guardrails
(Leitschienen) and similar — each with a position along the road
(chainage/station), side (left/right) and map coordinate.

Constraints that shape the approach:

- **No GNSS track** in the video. Only sparse manual position fixes
  (start/end, roughly every 60 s, ±5 m) are available.
- **Road geometry is a weak prior**: the reference centerline of mountain
  roads is often inaccurate or incomplete, so it cannot be used as a hard
  constraint.
- **Everything runs locally**; no footage is uploaded to third-party services.

See [docs/concept.md](docs/concept.md) for the approach.
